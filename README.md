🛡️ GuardAI: Online Payment Fraud Detection & AI Assistant
GuardAI is a hybrid financial security platform that combines traditional Machine Learning for high-precision fraud detection with Generative AI for intelligent user support.

By utilizing the CatBoost algorithm and a custom RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline, GuardAI provides both security and explainability for modern digital transactions.

🚀 Key Features
Real-time Fraud Prediction: Analyzes transactions instantly using a CatBoost model optimized for high-precision (

).
Intelligent Feature Engineering: Calculates "Balance Inaccuracy" (mismatches between transaction amounts and balance changes) to identify fraudulent patterns.
Context-Aware AI Assistant: A built-in chatbot powered by Google Gemini 2.0 Flash and Agno (Phidata) that answers user queries about transaction fields and security alerts.
Vector Search Knowledge Base: Uses PostgreSQL with pgvector to store and retrieve application documentation for the chatbot.
Modern Web UI: A clean, responsive dashboard built with Flask and Bootstrap 5.

📊 Dataset
The model is trained on the Online Payments Fraud Detection Dataset from Kaggle.

Source: Kaggle Dataset Link

Size: ~6.3 Million rows (Note: dataset.csv is excluded from this repo due to size; please download it manually for training).

⚙️ Installation & Setup
1. Clone the Repository
Bash
git clone [https://github.com/bhagwatankita/GuardAI-OnlinePaymentFraud-Detection.git](https://github.com/bhagwatankita/GuardAI-OnlinePaymentFraud-Detection.git)
cd GuardAI-OnlinePaymentFraud-Detection
2. Set Up Virtual Environment (Recommended)
Bash
python -m venv venv
# Activate on Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Activate on Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Database Setup
Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed with the pgvector extension.

Create a database named OnlinePaymentFraudAgentDB.

Update the db_url in agent.py with your credentials:

Python
db_url = "postgresql+psycopg://user:password@localhost:5432/OnlinePaymentFraudAgentDB"
5. Environment Variables
You need a Google AI API Key for the chatbot. Set it in your environment or directly in agent.py:

Python
os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
🚀 Running the Application
Train the Model (Optional)
If you wish to re-train the model or optimize the threshold:

Bash
python data_cleaning_training.py
Start the Flask App
Bash
python app.py
Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000.
